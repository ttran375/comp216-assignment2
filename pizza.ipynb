    "\n",
    "From the test harness and the given output, try to deduce the definition\n",
    "of the Pizza class. Code this class in a Colab notebook and copy the\n",
    "test harness to a cell below. Execute the notebook and ensure that the\n",
    "output matches EXACTLY with the output on the following page.\n",

    "You must use python f-strings for your output.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the code is so simple no code documentation is required, however\n",
    "you must put your name and the current date somewhere at the top of your\n",
    "code.\n",

    "See the folder documentation for due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the course documentation for policy on deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications for the Pizza class\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of this class is almost simplistic! All of the\n",
    "methods (except two) are only single code statements. My class\n",
    "implementation is only 30 lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that class members do not have a \"self\" prefix and are accessed\n",
    "with the class name and the dot operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Valid sizes for pizza contained in a collection at the class\n",
    "    level.  \n",
    "    You get to decode on the type of collection to store the sizes\n",
    "    below.  \n",
    "    Valid sizes are small, medium, large and x-large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another class level collection having the prices for each valid\n",
    "    size.  \n",
    "    You get to decide on the type of collection to store the prices\n",
    "    below.  \n",
    "    Prices are small: $6.49, medium: $8.49, large: $10.49, x-large:\n",
    "    $13.49.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods have an implicit first argument \"self\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A constructor that takes a default size of medium and topping of a\n",
    "    list of cheese that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Set the first argument size to the instance attribute size. Size\n",
    "        must be verified. This can be done by setting the size property.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Creates an instance attribute a list with the second argument.\n",
    "        If the second argument is missing, a single cheese topping is\n",
    "        inserted in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods have an implicit first argument \"self\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method that takes an argument of type list of strings. It adds\n",
    "    topping to the list of pizza toppings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the \\_\\_str\\_\\_() method to return a formatted string.\n",
    "    Examine the output from the test harness for clues on how to\n",
    "    implement this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance properties have an implicit first argument \"self\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A property that returns the price of the pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Price is based on the size as well as the number of toppings.  \n",
    "        See spec#2 for cost based on size. Each topping cost an\n",
    "        additional $0.50 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A property that returns the size of the pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A property that sets the size of the pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Size must be verified. A ValueError exception is raised if the\n",
    "        size is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the following Instance attributes are initialized in the\n",
    "constructor from the values of the argument. Notice the \\_\\_ prefix to\n",
    "make is private.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \\_\\_size is a str that stores the size of this object. This is\n",
    "    initialized in the constructor. It is mutated by the property in #8.\n",
    "    It is returned in #7. It is used in #6 to calculate the cost of the\n",
    "    pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \\_\\_toppings a list of string that represents the toppings for this\n",
    "    object. This is initialized in the constructor. It is mutated in the\n",
    "    add() method and is used in #6 to calculate the cost of the pizza.\n",
    "\n",
